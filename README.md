My first understanding of the assessment was everyone should do the web assessment and then pick any other assessment they can handle effectively. not until monday evening when i was reviewing the instructions i discovered that i misinterpreted the instruction, which am greatly sorry for and would plead that the negative consequences of my actions should be considered and reduced to the bearest minimum.
In the light of that, i didnt work on the pagination, search and download button, however the primary focus on the video was implemented.
Also the api has slight issues with quick loading or maybe its my internet speed though.
